Way to find which position correspond to which image

Way to etermine the threshold
Other method than contours
improve the code : implement a method to fill the contour, so that there is no inner contour. This create some that are quit big 
and one has to increase to the erase rate to get rid of them, which does not gives the chance to other contour from other instances
to be detected !!! then detect the contours again wiht the corrected filled shapes.
Maybe this problem dispappear in real life as they is a difference of intensity.

Play with the intensity of RGB as well for the diff image.

Use denoising for difff images

Compute filter bounding box related to the biggest rate BB/pointcloud. Problem if person immobil though, the trees will not be covered.
Define an average bouding box size from last images. Parameters are constantly updated thanks to what the learn, and discard outliers.
Be careful with the issue of related the biggest, if one person is immobil that does not work that much anymore : both immobil and minimum.

Why move does not always empty the class before ? How do unable it if the class is not declared inside a pointer, or all the member variable are not pointer ?
